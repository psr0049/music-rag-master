- Successfully loads 4,630 tracks from final_dataset.csv
- Proper data cleaning and preprocessing
- Rich text descriptions generated for RAG

### ✅ **4. RAG System Initialization**
**Problem:** No issues found - system working correctly  
**Status:** ✅ Working perfectly
- ChromaDB vector store setup successful
- Sentence transformer embeddings generated
- Semantic search functionality working

### ✅ **5. Recommendation Generation**
**Problem:** No issues found - system working correctly
**Status:** ✅ Working perfectly
- Text-based recommendations working
- Audio feature-based recommendations working
- Hybrid recommendations working
